 Project Title: ATS Resume Parser & Visualizer
üîç Description
This project is a web-based ATS (Applicant Tracking System) resume parser and visualizer built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to upload their resumes in PDF format and automatically extracts and displays information for further analysis or review.

Originally built using pdf2image, the app converts PDFs to images for content extraction. However, for better deployability (like on Streamlit Cloud), you can optionally use PyMuPDF (pure Python) instead.
